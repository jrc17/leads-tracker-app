# Leads Tracker – Chrome Extension

The Leads Tracker is a simple Chrome extension that allows users to save and manage website links they want to revisit later.

## Features

- Save the current tab’s URL
- View saved links in a list
- Delete links when no longer needed
- Data persists using browser local storage

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Browser Local Storage

## Installation

This extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store.  
It can be installed locally by loading the project folder as an unpacked extension through Chrome’s Developer Mode.

## Notes

This project was built as part of a Scrimba frontend course.  
I implemented the local storage functionality and application logic. The `manifest.json` file was provided as part of the course material.
